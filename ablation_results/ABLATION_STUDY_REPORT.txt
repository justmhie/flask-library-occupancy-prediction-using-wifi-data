STUDY OBJECTIVE:
Quantify the impact of auxiliary temporal features (hour, day_of_week, is_weekend)
on occupancy prediction accuracy.

================================================================================
MODEL ARCHITECTURES
================================================================================

ABLATED MODEL (Baseline):

KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. QUANTIFIED IMPROVEMENT:
   - MAE reduced by -818.00% (from 2.91 to 26.71 users)
   - RMSE reduced by -434.91% (from 7.60 to 40.65 users)
   - R² increased by -96.50% (from 0.9662 to 0.0338)

2. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
   - Residual error std dev: Ablated = 7.60, Full = 40.61
   - Error distribution is tighter in Full model (centered closer to zero)
   - Full model shows -434.7% reduction in error variance

3. INTERPRETATION:
   The auxiliary temporal features (hour, day_of_week, is_weekend) provide the model
   with explicit knowledge of periodic patterns and contextual information:

   - HOUR: Captures daily cycles (morning rush, afternoon peak, evening decline)
   - DAY_OF_WEEK: Encodes weekly patterns (weekday vs weekend behavior)
   - IS_WEEKEND: Binary flag for weekend-specific occupancy dynamics

   These features help the model account for non-linear, periodic fluctuations
   driven by academic schedules and student behavior patterns.

THESIS/PAPER STATEMENT

RECOMMENDED TEXT:

"To evaluate the contribution of auxiliary temporal features, we conducted an
ablation study comparing two model variants: (1) an ablated model using only
the 24-hour occupancy sequence, and (2) the full model incorporating auxiliary
features (hour, day-of-week, weekend indicator). The inclusion of auxiliary
features resulted in a significant improvement in predictive accuracy,
reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by -818.0% (from 2.91 to
26.71 users) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by -434.9%
(from 7.60 to 40.65 users). The R² score increased from
0.9662 to 0.0338, representing a -96.5% improvement.
Residual error analysis (Figure Z) demonstrates that the full model produces
a tighter error distribution centered closer to zero, confirming that auxiliary
features effectively capture periodic patterns driven by academic schedules."
